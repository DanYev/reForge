Examples
========

This gallery contains examples of how to use reForge for different molecular dynamics workflows.
Each example is designed to be self-contained and demonstrates specific aspects of the reForge package.

The examples progress from simple concepts to more complex workflows:

1. **Hello World**: Basic CLI interface and job submission patterns
2. **File Management**: Advanced workflow patterns with submit.py
3. **Simple CG Protein**: Complete Go-Martini protein setup workflow  

Requirements for running these examples:

- Python 3.x with reForge package
- GROMACS 
- Access to HPC cluster with SLURM (for some examples)

Each example includes detailed documentation and can be run independently.
Copy the scripts to your working directory and modify as needed for your specific use case.
The utility functions can be imported and used in your own workflows for enhanced output analysis.

Complete workflows can be found in the `workflows directory <../workflows>`_ of the repository.
