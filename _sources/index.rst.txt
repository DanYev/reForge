Welcome to the home page of the reForge Python package.

Overview of reForge Package
---------------------------


   The reForge source code is hosted on GitLab at: https://github.com/DanYev/reforge

The reForge Python package provides a comprehensive suite of utilities designed for MD
simulations, analysis, and data processing workflows. It features optimized mathematical routines, 
GPU‐accelerated computations, and a variety of helper tools to streamline file I/O and data manipulation. 
Developed to support advanced research projects in simulation and analysis, reForge is available for 
public use under the GNU V3 License.

What's in reForge?
------------------

In a nutshell, the key components of reForge are:

- **Python package for Molecular Dynamics:**  
  Easy to use workflows for set-up, MD simulation and analysis of large biomolecular systems.

- **User friendly:**  
  One of the motivations behind reForge was to provide a user- and beginner-friendly interface
  for managing potentially hundreds or thousands of MD simulations. Examples of basic workflows
  can be found here `workflows <https://github.com/DanYev/reforge/tree/main/workflows>`_.

- **Optimized Mathematical Routines:**  
  Tools that leverage GPU and Cython acceleration for analysis tasks, significantly reducing 
  computation times.
